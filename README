TDD: Part 2 of fmtRewrap

Finish the job with fmtRewrap. Specifically, using TDD, produce a comprehensive test set and corresponding implmentation.

There are 4 deliverables for this assignment:

fmtRewrap.java and fmtRewrapTest.java These must be turned in on Blackboard. The GTA must be able to run your code against your tests for credit.
A short comparison of your final API with the original fmtRewrap interface. It is possible you will arrive at the same API.
A short assessment of your test cases from assignment 2. What is the relationship between your final TDD tests and your assignment 2 tests?
A short narrative of your TDD development process. That is, describe the order in which you considered your tests, how many TDD cycles you used, and what refactorings you found necessary.
The final two deliverables may be turned in either on Blackboard or simply on paper. Only the code/tests need be on Blackboard. For all deliverables, a paper copy will provide the GTA with a mechanism to provide feedback.
